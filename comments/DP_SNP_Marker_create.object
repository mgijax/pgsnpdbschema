COMMENT ON TABLE snp.DP_SNP_Marker IS 'A record in this table represents a dbSNP/marker/Function Class/Transcript relationship. It is the staging area for the raw data from dbSNP and is used by snpcacheload to create SNP/Marker relationships in the SNP_ConsensusSnp_Marker table and also used to establish the transcript/protein pairing in SNP_Transcript_Protein' ;

COMMENT ON COLUMN DP_SNP_Marker._SNPMarker_key IS 'Primary key';

COMMENT ON COLUMN DP_SNP_Marker.accID IS 'The RefSNP (ConsensusSnp) accession number string (excludes "rs")';

COMMENT ON COLUMN DP_SNP_Marker.entrezGeneId IS 'EntrezGene ID for the mouse marker dbSNP associates with "accID"';

COMMENT ON COLUMN DP_SNP_Marker._Fxn_Key IS 'dbSNP Function Class resolved to an MGI vocabulary key. The Function Class of the coordinate of the polymorphism in the marker, with respect to a specific transcript';

COMMENT ON COLUMN DP_SNP_Marker.chromosome IS 'The chromosome on which the RefSNP is found';

COMMENT ON COLUMN DP_SNP_Marker.startCoord IS 'Genome coordinate of the RefSNP';

COMMENT ON COLUMN DP_SNP_Marker.refseqNucleotide IS 'The RefSeq transcript for the marker represented by "entrezGeneId';

COMMENT ON COLUMN DP_SNP_Marker.refseqProtein IS 'The RefSeq protein for the marker represented by "entrezGeneId"';

COMMENT ON COLUMN DP_SNP_Marker.contig_allele IS 'The allele observed for the variant in the contig sequence. If function class="Contig-Reference", this is the reference allele by which the variation is defined';

COMMENT ON COLUMN DP_SNP_Marker.residue IS 'Abbreviation for the amino acid encoded in the contig sequence (coding SNPs only)';

COMMENT ON COLUMN DP_SNP_Marker.aa_position IS 'Position of the amino acid in the polypeptide sequence from the corresponding protein accession ID (coding SNPs only)';
